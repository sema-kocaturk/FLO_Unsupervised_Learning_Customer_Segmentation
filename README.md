Introduction
In this project, we perform customer segmentation analysis to group customers based on their order history, value, recency, and other attributes. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can provide insights for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer interactions.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

Python (3.7+)
Required Python packages (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-analysis.git
cd customer-segmentation-analysis
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Customer_Segmentation_Analysis.ipynb to follow the analysis steps.

The notebook covers these main stages:

Data preprocessing and transformation
Log transformation for normality
Feature scaling
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
Applying K-Means clustering
Applying Hierarchical Clustering
Analyzing and comparing clusters
Customize the code and parameters to suit your specific dataset and objectives.

Analysis Steps
The analysis comprises the following steps:

Data preprocessing and transformation
Log transformation for normality
Feature scaling
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
Applying K-Means clustering
Applying Hierarchical Clustering
Analyzing and comparing clusters
Results
The customer segmentation analysis yields insights into distinct customer groups based on their order history, value, recency, and other attributes. These segments can guide decision-making for marketing campaigns, customer retention strategies, and more.
